#### A bit about me
<img style="float:right; margin:5%; border-style:double; border-radius:5px; width:30%; min-width:140px;" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}assets/luke.jpg">

For anyone stumbling over this blog that doesn't know me, I'm a young(ish) Software Engineer from upstate New York. I'm
graduating from a local university in the Spring, then moving to the Golden State  to start my adventures as a professional(ish) developer.

#### Why am I doing this

More then anything, this blog is for my own sanity. I've learned to think of my brain as a really messy bedroom. Communication is crucial to keep myself as sharp as possible. In the same vein as teaching, sharing information with others about what I've learned validates what I *think* I know, and encourages me to dig deeper. Cheers.
